I greatly enjoy helping people, and as a student, one way for me to be helpful is teaching. I am able to share with people my love for knowledge and provide them with the means to realize their capabilities. ‘Aha’ moments and helping students grasp complex concepts give me a feeling that is truly indescribable.

## University of Tehran
In the following courses at the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at the University of Tehran, I was a teaching assistant. Along with other teaching assistants and the professor, I was mainly responsible for designing and grading assignments, projects, and exams as well as conducting practice and problem-solving sessions.

## Allameh Helli Middle School
During the 2020 academic year, I taught C++ programming language, elementary algorithms, and data structures to some talented students at Allameh Helli Middle School.



## Farzanegan High School
Partially, during the 2020 and 2021 academic years, besides solving algorithm problems, I taught advanced algorithms and data structures to some talented students at Farzanegan High School. I mainly used the Codeforces website problems and the book CLRS for my class.
