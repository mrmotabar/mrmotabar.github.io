I am a senior B.Sc. student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Tehran.\\
What I love most about computer science is the way theory and real-world solutions come together. While I enjoy the theoretical stuff, I also like making it practical and useful in our everyday lives or in different industries. I'm excited about taking what I learn in the classroom and turning it into something that can really make a difference.

## Interests

I love diving into the theoretical side of all computer science areas, especially when it comes to **Cryptography** â€“ blending math with computers is my jam!\\
I'm not just into one thing, though. I like working on **Designing Algorithms**, analyzing their complexity, and using them to solve problems. I'm also interested in **Automata Theory**, exploring the basic principles of computers. **Mechanism Design** and **Game Theory** are other areas I find fascinating.
